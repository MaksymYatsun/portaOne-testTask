The task is to find the following six values:

1. the maximum number in the file;
2. the minimum number in the file;
3. the median;
4. average arithmetic value;
5. the largest (consecutive) sequence of numbers that increases;
6. the largest (consecutive) sequence of numbers that is decreasing;

// How to run

Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine to run this program. Navigate to the folder containing the program and execute 'node findStats.js' in your command line interface. The results will be displayed in your terminal.

Min: -49999996
Median: 25216
Arithmetic Mean: 7364.418442641844
Longest Increasing Sequence: 10
